./script/generate gwt_resource ActiveRecordModelName GwtClientName

Example: script/generate gwt_resource Project dashboard

This generates Project.java which extends ProjectBase.java, placing them both
under app/gwt/dashboard/src/dashboard/client/resource. ProjectBase.java will
be regenerated after each ActiveRecord migration.

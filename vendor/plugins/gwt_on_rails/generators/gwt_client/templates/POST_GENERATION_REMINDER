Your GWT client has been generated.

To compile:

> rake your_gwt_client_name:compile

To run in "hosted" mode:

> rake your_gwt_client_name:hosted

After your first compile, you can simply refresh the hosted mode browser to
pick up new source changes.

To clean:

> your_gwt_client_name:clean

The source is in app/gwt/your_gwt_client_name.

The compiled code will appear under public/gwt/YourGwtModuleName
i.e public/gwt/dashboard.Dashboard

In order to use the included GWT-REST module with the default Rails
scaffolding, check out the json_request plugin from Labnotes:

===============================================================================

Migrations have also been extended to keep a client-side object in sync with
your ActiveRecord migrations.

Just generate a stub client-side resource and your usual migrations will keep
everything in sync:

> script/generate gwt_resource RailsModelName gwt_client_name
> rake db:migrate

The above will generate RailsModelNameBase and a stub, RailsModelName
that extends this. The Base class will be recreated with each migration, adding
or removing properties along with your Rails models. The code can be found
under app/gwt/your_gwt_client_name/src/yourgwtpackagename/client/resource.
